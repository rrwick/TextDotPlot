# TextDotPlot

TextDotPlot is a crude little program I wrote to make a bioinformatics-style dot plot using any text as input.  I made it because I had rearranged a large piece of text a number of times (my Master's thesis) and wanted to check that there weren't any duplicated sections.

## Help

Run `TextDotPlot -h` to see the command line arguments it takes.

## Installation

This program uses Qt 5.  To build, first run `qmake` to generate a Makefile, and then build the program with `make`.
